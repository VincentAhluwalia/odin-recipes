This is going to be a website about recipes. The main index page will have links to recipes. It's not going
to look pretty but I'm gonna do my best to make it look as best as possible. I'm gonna have to write a HTML boilerplate and I'm going to have to use lists as well as hyperlinks and probably images if I want the website to look less boring. 

I'm writing this before I start coding but I think the whole website will be fairly easy to make. HTML in general is easy in my opinion. I'm curious if I'm gonna eat my words later on. 

The exercises were in fact very easy. I just want to correct myself, I don't think that HTML as a whole is easy, just these beginning exercises. I took a peek at how many courses are still to come
and I hope that I'll have the discipline to go through them all, since I'm already taking ages for the foundations course.
