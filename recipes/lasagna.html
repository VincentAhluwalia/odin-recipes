            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water.
                <br>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, <strong>1 teaspoon</strong> salt, pepper, and <strong>2 tablespoons</strong> parsley.
                 Simmer, covered, for about <strong>1 1/2 hours</strong>, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for <strong>8</strong> to <strong>10 minutes</strong>. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
                <br> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and <strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong> salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375 degrees F</strong> (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread <strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> of meat sauce in the bottom of a <strong>9x13-inch</strong> baking dish. Arrange <strong>6</strong> noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture.
                <br> Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon <strong>1 1/2 cups</strong> meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with <strong>1/4 cup</strong> Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                <br> Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for <strong>25 minutes</strong>. Remove foil, and bake an additional <strong>25 minutes</strong>. Cool for <strong>15 minutes</strong> before serving.</li>
        </ol>
