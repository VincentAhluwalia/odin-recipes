        <h2>Easy Indian Butter Chicken Recipe</h2>
        <p> 
            An easy butter chicken recipe I've perfected over the years and shared with many others. 
            The sauce is perfect when creamy and not too thick or too thin. 
        </p>

            The level of salt and spices can be suited to your taste. 
            Garam and tandoori masala can be found in the ethnic aisle of your grocery store.
